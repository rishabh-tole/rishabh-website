                The first time I read this quote, it changed my perspective on what it means to lack access to
                education. It showed that this problem extended beyond the fact that some children could not afford
                education, but that education did not exist in these rural parts of India. Growing up in a family that
                valued education above all else, I learned firsthand the transformative power it holds. Witnessing the
                sacrifices my parents made to ensure I had access to quality education opened my eyes to its profound
                impact on shaping one's life.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                I wanted to give back to the community and found that I could use my passion for teaching and knowledge
                of programming to host a summer camp about the basics of Python. This was a great opportunity to teach
                the younger generation about programming and how it is an extremely useful skill to have. It was amazing
                to see a bunch of kids get excited about programming while raising some money for Ekal, allowing me to
                achieve two goals at once!

            <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                I felt empowered knowing the charity I support is making a real difference, giving education to folks in
                super tough spots that even the government struggles to reach. So, as the Ekal Youth Leader for the
                Boston chapter, I decided to dedicate my whole Manch Pravesh, a "Music Solo Concert," to Ekal Vidyalaya.
                We managed to pull in about <strong>$2,500</strong> for the cause!

                    Ekal Sa Re Ta Re 2024 was an incredible success! After learning from last year's event, we
                    streamlined the registration process, improved communication, and added new categories, making it
                    smoother and more exciting for participants.

                    What truly moved me was watching the 4th and 5th graders confidently stand on stage, sharing how
                    inspired they were to contribute and help underserved communities. One of the most touching moments
                    came when a 9th grader approached me, saying they were inspired by my efforts and now want to start
                    a dance version of this event. It's amazing how a small act of service can spark such a ripple
                    effect, multiplying the impact beyond what I could have imagined.

                    Music transcends the barrier of language and is the single most potent way to bring people together
                    from around the world. In my family, my grandfather provided opportunities to lesser-known and
                    upcoming artists, and I aim to continue that tradition.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    I always longed for a chance to sing on stage but opportunities were scarce, especially when I was
                    very young. While some regional groups organize such competitions, they often cater to specific
                    affinity groups, leaving many without a platform to shine. Since I was just 6 years old, I dreamed
                    of creating a fair stage for young musicians to showcase their talent in any language. Ekal provided
                    me with the opportunity to turn my dream into a reality.

                    The competition was a huge success, and the fluidity with which it ran was a testament to the
                    countless hours that were poured into planning it. The Judges as well as the audience commented that
                    it felt more like a concert than a competition!
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    The most remarkable and surprising aspect of this competition was the source of the majority of our
                    funds. The students were incredibly moved by the presentation of the cause, leading them to donate
                    all of their money earned from their various jobs. One student contributed their entire earnings
                    from a summer babysitting job, while another generously donated a significant portion of their
                    income from a dog-sitting business. The satisfaction of giving back is incomparable. Witnessing
                    everyone unite and collaborate towards the goal of educating underprivileged children was truly
                    mesmerizing!
