            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Dyslexia, a condition that usually affects reading and writing, also hinders spatial awareness,
                especially with maps. People with dyslexia struggle to convert 2D images on maps into 3D spatial
                direction in real life. This difficulty arises from differences in how their brains process visual and
                spatial signals. Despite extensive research, there's still no widely available solution, prompting my
                efforts to develop one.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">My Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p>
                I’m developing a device inspired by a 3D Pin-art toy to help people with dyslexia navigate more
                effectively.
                <br><br>
                Each pin will be individually controllable, allowing for tactile interaction with a 3D map displayed on
                a flexible OLED screen, similar to Samsung’s foldable phone displays. The device will combine tactile,
                visual, and auditory elements to create a multisensory navigation experience.
                <br><br>
                A companion app will handle GPS functions and heavy calculations, allowing the device to stay
                lightweight. The app will include general city navigation and specialized features for digitizing maps
                of theme parks, parks, and other areas.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Expert Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                I recently presented my MapPin' project to Mrs. Valerie Rapowitz, who was excited about its potential to
                improve navigation for people with dyslexia. She encouraged me to present it at the International
                Dyslexia Association’s upcoming conference in Dallas. She also pointed out that the device could benefit
                not only dyslexics but also individuals with speech impediments who struggle with navigation, as well as
                those who are visually impaired. With her feedback regarding auditory inputs and tactile value for ADHD
                users, I plan to refine MapPin' from a basic prototype into a fully functional tool.

                    <h3>V5: Current Version</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the final proof of concept version of MapPin, I combined the reliability and low tolerances
                        of Lego parts with custom 3D printed components. This allowed me to create a tactile map with a
                        4x4 resolution, providing a tactile experience.

                <h3>V4: Quick MVP</h3>
                <p>
                    For my next version, I wanted to get to an MVP as soon as possible so that I could user test this. I
                    decided to rig an existing pin-art toy to some servos. By removing the plexiglass and grouping pins
                    using plates, I could rotate the servos attached to a helix structure to drive the pins up.
                    <br><br>
                    I knew the 4x5 setup was low resolution and the 10-second update time was slow, but it was
                    sufficient to demonstrate the concept.
                </p>

                    <h3>Input Processing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tracking user movements accurately over small distances is crucial. Public GPS is not accurate
                        enough, so I used an MPU9205 9-axis IMU.
                        <br><br>
                        simply integrating angular accelerations of the gyro worked for heading, but displacement was
                        noisy. I looked into Kalman Filters and the Madgwick Algorithm to clean this data.
                        <br><br>
                        Currently, I have placed a button that, when pressed, simulates walking forward a small
                        distance, which is sufficient for a proof of concept.

                    <h3>Path Planning & Map Conversion</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Path Planning:</strong> I implemented a Breadth First Search to find the shortest path
                        from the user (Blue Circle) to the target. This removes irrelevant roads from the 3D rendering.
                        I explored EBS-A* for future optimization on primitive hardware.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Map Conversion:</strong> Instead of proprietary maps, I intend for users to feed in a
                        map of the area. My software currently uses a simple algorithm to check pixel color intensity to
                        identify paths. For complex maps like theme parks, I plan to take user input to highlight paths,
                        avoiding the heavy resource cost of training large CNN models.

                <h3>Software & Hardware Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a software architecture to handle logical interactions. On the hardware side, I tested
                    low-power solenoids but found they drew too much current (0.5 amps) and overheated. Staggered power
                    cycles didn't solve the issue, leading me to reconsider the hardware approach.

                <h3>V3: Pivoting Approach</h3>
                <p>
                    After speaking to a PhD student at MIT, I learned that dynamic pins might not be as valuable if
                    users don't care about the specific obstruction type (tree vs building). I experimented with
                    constraining the problem.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried low-voltage solenoid pistons to simplify the design, accepting that the 3D representation
                    resolution would decrease. I realized that reaching a true MVP with 9g servos was physically
                    impossible due to wire management and update cycle latency.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the multiplexed servo system worked! I could host a web server and establish a websocket
                    connection with the app, marking the proof of concept as a success.

                    <p>
                        My first version was originally made in CAD, featuring 24 9g servos arranged to actuate the
                        pins. This laid the groundwork for understanding the spatial constraints and mechanical
                        requirements of the device.
