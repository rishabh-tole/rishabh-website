                        <h3>Hindustani Classical Music</h3>
                        <p class="tagline" style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 10px; color: var(--text-secondary);">
                            Vocals</p>
                        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">My journey in Hindustani Classical Music has been a profound and
                            enriching experience, beginning at 4 and culminating in my Vocal Arangetram in August '23.
                            Throughout the past 13 years, I've devoted myself to honing my musical skills, allowing me
                            to express myself deeply through the art form. For the past three years, I have expanded my
                            repertoire beyond just classical music and have begun to learn Indian light and western
                            non-classical songs as well.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">My passion for music extends beyond personal growth; I am driven to
                            use my talents to make a positive impact by integrating music with education for
                            underprivileged children, aiming to inspire and uplift through the transformative power of
                            both music and learning. Thanks to the support of Ekal Vidyalaya, the inception of the
                            annual musical competition, Ekal Sa Re Ta Re, has become a reality.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">My experience in singing different styles of music has led me to
                            appreciate the different expressions each style brings. This perspective helped me realize
                            the problem we face today: the top charts of music all contain the same sets of chords and
                            similar structures. Thus began my research into AI music generation.</p>

                        <h3>Dholi Beats</h3>
                        <p class="tagline" style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 10px; color: var(--text-secondary);">
                            Professional Percussion Service</p>
                        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">I founded a small entertainment Business where play Dhol at weddings,
                            gatherings, and formal events. I love the fact that I can get people dance to my beats and
                            become part of people's happy memories. When playing at events, the crowd and I feed off of
                            each other's energy to make everyone's experience more enjoyable.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">Learning to play the dhol has deepened my understanding of rhythm and
                            helped me in my other forms of music as well. A large part of classical music is
                            improvisation and something that every musician must have is the ability to subconsciously
                            count beats. Playing drums has made this second nature to me and helped me tremendously to
                            gain a higher level of understanding of rhythms and it has aided me significantly in my
                            classical music.</p>
                        <p style="margin: 20px 0;">My passion for playing the dhol has inspired me to initiate a project
                            focused specifically on this area. Typically, the captivating and enveloping sound of
                            percussion instruments is achieved by multiple instruments playing simultaneously. However,
                            since very few people pursue this instrument, having many dhols is not always possible. So,
                            to try and replicate the effect of multiple dhols, DJ's often held the microphone near the
                            dhol, spreading the localized sound to the entire hall. Yet, the sticks kept hitting the mic
                            ruining the signature sound of the dhol. This prompted me to find a solution to enhance the
                            sound of the dhol and spreading it to the entire hall. Since the only good solution required
                            me to drill a hole into the drum, compromising its structural integrity, I set off trying to
                            create my own. I am very close to a final product and have started using it for my gigs. See
                            my progress here!</p>
